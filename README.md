# AfterRun
app that sends command to Termux

## Making it work
- must have Termux and Termux:API installed
- must have run this command on Termux first:
- ```pkg install termux-api && echo "allow-external-apps = true" >> "$HOME/.termux/termux.properties"```

## Edit this AfterRun project
- this is an AIDE project
- which means it can only be build using AIDE
- will have separate md file for this topic later...
