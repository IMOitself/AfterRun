# AfterRun
accepts apk from AIDE after running project

# How it works
- AIDE opens the apk file of a project after building
- the 'Open With' dialog will be open and AfterRun will show on choices
- AfterRun will then locate the project folder and performs command
- it will use Termux:API to call a command e.g ```git status```

# How to edit AfterRun project
- will have separate md file for this topic later...
